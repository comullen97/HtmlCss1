            <h3>Welcome to our Safe Haven!</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my safe haven. This is my escape where I can share the full honest unfiltered truth on my life, situations I’ve been caught in, inner demons I’ve struggled with, and past mistakes I’ve made. However in the end, despite all the chaos life has thrown at me (and you as well). I am so close to being on track to discovering the true me, and I could not be happier with the progress I have made, and hope to help get you there too!
                Scary and intimidating as it is to put my life out there, and that uneasy feeling of vulnerability (something you will soon discover I struggled with). I can honestly say that I am ready to share, not only for you guys but for myself as well. To be comfortable discussing the good, the bad, my reality. Taking that next step in my healing process and normalizing all the madness life threw at me. The mountains that I conquered, the ones I know you are currently summitting . But hey... look at us now, we are all taking those next steps to better ourselves or else none of us would be here on this page right now, myself included.</p>

            <h3>Hi, I'm the face behind the blogs</h3>
            <img src="http://www.google.image" alt="page-photo" width= 150px>
            <p>Hi! I'm Casey

                I am a 24 year old who is aspiring to achieve self-confidence and am now making it ONE of my life goals to help others achieve their true potential too. Come join me on my journey! Here is a little recap on the past 6 years of my life. I nearly gave my family a heart attack by enlisting in the US Navy Reserves. I attended UW- Eau Claire majoring in Biochemistry on the pre-med route then transferred to UW- La Crosse to finish my degree, but dropped out with 3 semesters left. One month later I decided to pick up my life and everything I knew in Wisconsin with my husband and move to Bozeman, MT. Guess what? I am now divorced, still currently living in Bozeman with my furry companion Bailey! Here you can find us in our free time hiking, rollerblading, and exploring this gorgeous state, and vowing not to take life too seriously!
                I know what a mouthful that was, and I'm sure you are questioning if you should follow my story and listen to any advice from me. Yes, yes you should! I am here to share my stories and experiences and be real with you on the dark, hard truths and realities we face in life!
                I know how chaotic life can be, and the roller coaster of emotions that follow. I'm familiar with the feeling of being alone in isolation, with the weight of the world on your shoulders, while doing your best to stay strong, survive, and never let them see you cry.
                I wasn't ready for half the shit I went through - but obviously I was built for it. So are you.

                Let's get through this together.
